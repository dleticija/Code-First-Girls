              Hi my name is Morag Coleman, Manager of FFSA. I have had many years'
              experience in the voluntary and statutory sectors supporting
              children and their families, as a paid and unpaid worker. I started
              working for Families First in September 2011. As my role involves
              a lot of the behind the scenes stuff, such as carrying out tasks
              for the directors, attracting funding and bringing everyone's
              ideas together, I don't get to meet many of the people we work
              with. However, when I do, I have a great time and really enjoy
              getting to know them. It also helps me to keep grounded and
              reminds me of the reason I do my job.

              Hi! My name is Alison Miller and I am the Children's Group Work
              Coordinator at Families First. I organise and run all of the group
              work at Families First. This includes 13+ Groups, Schools work,
              Transition Groups and Holiday Activities. I have a strong group
              of volunteers who help out with these groups who I also support
              individually. I got into this area of work after having volunteered
              at different groups and organisations such as youth groups and dance
              classes since 2003. I went on to study Community Education at
              Dundee University and from there, I joined Families First in my
              current position where I have been since 2010. Every day is an
              enjoyable one at Families First! Alison is currently on maternity
              leave until July 2017.

                 additional needs. I started working for Families First in May 2016
                 and every day brings new challenges and opportunities. I have a large

            <p class="description">
              I arrived in the St Andrews area a few years ago and was delighted
              to encounter Families First which I had heard about because my
              daughter, who had been a student here, used to volunteer as a befriender.
              My background in administration both overseas and in the UK prepared me
              well for the position of Office Manager. I've been with the organisation
              since August 2011. Part of my role is to be the first point of contact
              when people phone or call in at the office. I take this seriously
              because we want to be both welcoming and helpful to the many people
              who we come into contact with, whether they are service users, other
              agencies, volunteers or members of the community. I also take care
              of a lot of the day to day administration, which includes processing
              volunteer applications. It is a joy to meet so many volunteers, most
              of whom are students, who are willing to give their time and energy
              to supporting this work.

              Hi.  My name is Neryl Malcomson and I’m the Finance Officer.
              Before taking a career break to bring up my children, I worked in
              financial administration.  I have been involved in various community
              roles over the past few years and most recently volunteered as a
              family support worker in the local area.  I’m delighted to join
              the team at Families First as I can combine my financial administration
              background with serving the community through the fantastic work of
              Families First.
