      Volunteering can be one of the most rewarding and beneficial choices many of us will make in life. The reason that volunteers choose to volunteer can be varied, such as wanting to give something back, meeting new people, making new friends or learning new skills. Whatever your motivation, Families First is prepared to welcome you and support you.

      If you choose to volunteer with Families First, it not only benefits you, as you develop new skills and make a valuable contribution, it benefits the organisation and the people who use our services. With your help, we are able to deliver the services we commit to and ensure that our service users receive a quality service that meets and supports their needs.
      <br>
      <br>
      We have a strong commitment to the volunteers who work with us. We have on average 80 volunteers who support the work we do. Families First volunteers hold a number of roles within the organisation which include Trustees, administration, driving, and direct service delivery.

              Befrienders work with us to support children and young people on a one-to-one basis. The type of support provided depends on what has been agreed with the child, their primary carers and other agencies in terms of need and the child’s goals. This support usually takes place after school in the Rose Lane Centre. You need to have a genuine interest in promoting the children and young people’s right and well-being. We are looking for caring people who are good listeners and have interests in activities such as sports, arts and crafts, cooking, playing games, going for walks and hanging out!
              <br>
              <br>
              Befrienders need to commit to a minimum of approximately 2 hours per fortnight for befriending sessions, plus additional time for supervision, training and briefing sessions.

              Volunteers who work with children and young people in a group work setting could be involved in a number of ways ranging from youth groups, holiday activities to schools work. The purpose of our group activities is to create opportunities for children to work and socialise together in a positive way. We work with children and young people to develop their skills in team building, communication, sharing and addressing their worries in a constructive way. If you like to be part of a team and work with others, this could be a role for you.
              <br>
              <br>
              Some of the groups only run during term time and others run during the holidays; some are weekly and some are run every fortnight. Volunteers in children's group work need to commit to a minimum of 1-2 hours per week (depending on the activity), plus additional time for supervision, training and briefing sessions.

              Family support is based on supporting the adults involved in a
              child’s life; again we can do this through one-to-one and group
              work activities. We usually support the adult to achieve the goals
              they have set. Our Parents and Carers group (PaCs) is an excellent
              platform for peer support and the sharing of ideas and experiences.
              We welcome enquiries from volunteers who have skills in, or would
              like to develop their skills in supporting adults.
              <br>
              <br>
              Some of the support is only offered during term time and others
              all year round. This service also organises the family fun days
              and activities. Volunteers who work with adults will be expected to
              commit to at least 1-2 hours in their chosen activity, plus additional
              time for supervision, training and briefing sessions.

              The children and young people we support live all over rural North
              East Fife. Some are very isolated because they live in rural areas.
              Our volunteer drivers help us to get children and young people who
              live in these areas to their activities with us. Drivers must have
              a full clean driving licence and be able to have business use included
              on their car insurance certificate.
              <br>
              <br>
              All drivers will be reimbursed with their out of pocket expenses.
              Drivers should be confident in communicating with children who have
              additional support needs. We would love to hear from you if you have
              an hour or two to spare every week or fortnight, we mostly need
              drivers in the evening. You will also need to commit to additional
              time for supervision, training and briefing sessions.

              If you are looking for a volunteering role where you want to support
              a charity, but are not so keen to work directly with people, this
              volunteering role may suit you better. We are always looking for people
              to support the administration functions of the organisation in roles
              such as collating and inputting data, preparing volunteer training
              packs, filing, shredding, archiving and managing resources.
              <br>
              <br>
              The time commitment for any of these roles is negotiable to suit
              you and can be discussed further with our office manager. You will
              also need to commit to additional time for supervision, training
              and briefing sessions.

              Anyone who is interested in volunteering with us should join our
              Facebook page or look out or further announcements on our website
              of when the next Volunteer Information Meeting (VIM) is. These meetings
              enable you to find out more about volunteering for Families First,
              the services we offer and whether we are the organisation you would
              like to volunteer with.
              <br>
              <br>
              These meetings give participants a better understanding of our
              organisation and the frequency of our services as they vary greatly
              depending on time of year and who uses them.  If you decide to continue
              on with us and become a volunteer you will receive full training and
              support to carry out your role. You will be allocated a named supervisor
              who will provide you with additional support should you require it.
              All volunteers who work directly with vulnerable adults and children will
              be required to complete a PVG application form.
